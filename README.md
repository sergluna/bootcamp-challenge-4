## Bootcamp Challenge 4
# Description

The repository for challenge 4 of my Web Development bootcamp. Here you will find the files required for submission. For this challenge we were tasked with creating a coding quiz that would ask the user a series of questions to test their coding knowledge.
# Deployed Application
https://sergluna.github.io/bootcamp-challenge-4/

Here is a link to the deployed application.
# Usage

To view my submission please review the index.html file. When the user visits the page they will see a start button that when pushed will start the timer and a question will be presented. If the question is answered correctly then another question is prompted. If the question is answered incorrectly then time is deducted from the timer and a new question is prompted. Once all questions are answered or the timer runs out then the user can save the results.
